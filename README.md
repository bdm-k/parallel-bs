This repository is in search for the most efficient implement of bitonic sorting network by golang. In this context, bitonic sorting network interpret any length of sequences.  
Thanks for [H.W.Lang's website](http://www.iti.fh-flensburg.de/lang/algorithmen/sortieren/bitonic/oddn.htm) I could understand the basic implementation method of bitonic sorting network for any length of sequences.
